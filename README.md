# Meli-Data-Challenge-2021
Machine learning model to forecast item inventory days based on Mercado Libre historical data. 


### The challenge:

Every day, Mercadolibre's shipping unit (MercadoEnvíos) delivers thousands of products across Latin America.

In order to provide customers with the best experience throughout the shipping process, it is critical to have accurate sales forecasts.

At the core of this business problem, lies the Data Challenge task: given the historical sales time-series for a subset of the martketplace's listings, we challenge you to predict how long will it take for a given item to run out of stock.
